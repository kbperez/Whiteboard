# Whiteboard Challenge 2

Write a function that takes in a numeric array and returns an object literal with two properties: - The highest and second highest value in the array

My tests for this function are:
1. Is the input an array?  If not, return null.
2. Is the input all numbers?  If not, return null.
3. Are there at least two unique values in the array? If not, return null.
4. Does the function return the correct values with intergers?
5. Does the function return the correct values with decimals and/or integers?
