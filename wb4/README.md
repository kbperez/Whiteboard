# Whiteboard Challenge 4

Write a function that will return the intersection of 2 arrays.  The array content can be anything - strings, numbers, booleans, etc.  The return is a new array.

My tests for this function are:
1. Are there 2 inputs?  If not, return null.
2. Is the input arrays?  If not, return null.
3. Are there matches? If not, return 'no matches'.
5. Does the function return the correct answer?
